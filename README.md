Logerr or Log Error. Playing with console errors, experimental project. Started developing for Chrome but now it supports Internet Explorer as well as Edge.

#### Online Demo
[View](https://i-break-codes.github.io/logerr/) (Don't forget to open your dev console)

---

#### What does it do?
Provides JavaScript error details in a readable format. You can log these errors remotely by enabling `remoteLogging`. After enabling, logerr will send a post request to the desired action/url with exception details along with custom parameters (if provided using `additionalParams`).

#### Setup
Just include `logerr.js` file and the `init()` i.e initializer in the `<head>` section of your page, before you include any other JavaScript. `init()` will initialize the lib, where later you can pass an object to customize.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script src="logerr.js"></script>
	<script>
	  Logerr.init();
	</script>
  </head>
  <body>
    Am fancy
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Enable remote logging
> Make sure you have CORS enabled if logging cross-domain.

```javascript
//Request type is POST

Logerr.init({
  remoteLogging: true, //Checkout https://github.com/i-break-codes/logerr-remote
  remoteSettings: {
    url: 'REMOTE_URL',
    additionalParams: {
      logged_by: 'Sam'
    },
    successCallback: function () {
      console.log('Im logged.');
    },
    errorCallback: function () {
      console.log('Err! Something went wrong.');
    }
  }
});
```
